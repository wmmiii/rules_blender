# Rules Blender

This repository provides a set of Bazel rules to render Blender files.

## Usage

After including rules_blender in your project you can use these rules to transform Blender files into rasterized images:

```
load("@rules_blender//:blender.bzl", "blender_image")

blender_image(
    name = "rendered_frame",
    srcs = "//:my_file.blend",
    frame = 5,
)
```

See the [examples](examples) directory for more details!

## Disclaimer

Please note this is a joke ruleset and should not be used in any serious project.

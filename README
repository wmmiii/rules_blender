# Rules Blender

This repository provides a set of Bazel rules to render Blender files.

## Usage

After including rules_blender in your project you can use these rules to transform Blender files into rasterized images:

```
load("@rules_blender//:blender.bzl", "blender_image", "blender_video")

blender_image(
    name = "rendered_frame",
    srcs = "//:my_file.blend",
    frame = 5,
)

blender_video(
    name = "rendered_video",
    srcs = "//:my_file.blend",
    end_frame = 240,
    framerate = 24,
)
```

See the [examples](examples) directory for more details!
